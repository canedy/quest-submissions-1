Explain why we wouldn't call changeGreeting in a script.

because changeGreeting represents a string


What does the AuthAccount mean in the prepare phase of the transaction?

accessing the information/data in an account


What is the difference between the prepare phase and the execute phase in the transaction?

prepare phase is regarding accessing the information/data in an account while the execute phase calls functions and does stuff to change the data on the blockchain


This is the hardest quest so far, so if it takes you some time, do not worry! I can help you in the Discord if you have questions.

Add two new things inside your contract:

A variable named myNumber that has type Int (set it to 0 when the contract is deployed)
A function named updateMyNumber that takes in a new number named newNumber as a parameter that has type Int and updates myNumber to be newNumber

pub contract HelloWorld {


pub var greeting: String

pub var myNumber: Int

    init() {
        self.greeting = "Hello, World!"

        self.myNumber = 0
           }


pub fun changeGreeting(newGreeting: String) {
    self.greeting = newGreeting
}

pub fun updateMyNumber(newNumber: Int) {
    self.myNumber = newNumber
}

}



Add a script that reads myNumber from the contract


import HelloWorld from 0x01

pub fun main(): Int {
    return HelloWorld.myNumber
}



Add a transaction that takes in a parameter named myNewNumber and passes it into the updateMyNumber function. 


import HelloWorld from 0x01

transaction(myNewNumber: Int) {

  prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {}

  execute {
    HelloWorld.updateMyNumber (newNumber: myNewNumber)
  }
}


Verify that your number changed by running the script again.
