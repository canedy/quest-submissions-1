What does .link() do?

accesses data in an account through the /public/ storage pathway


In your own words (no code), explain how we can use resource interfaces to only expose certain things to the /public/ path.

it can be used to limit what can be accessed by the public in a particularly account 


Deploy a contract that contains a resource that implements a resource interface. Then, do the following:

pub contract Quest {

  pub resource interface EYETest {
    pub var name: String
  }

  // `Test` now implements `EYETest`
  pub resource Test: EYETest {
    pub var name: String

    pub fun changeName(newName: String) {
      self.name = newName
    }

    init() {
      self.name = "Cyclops"
    }
  }

  pub fun createTest(): @Test {
    return <- create Test()
  }

}



In a transaction, save the resource to storage and link it to the public with the restrictive interface.


import Quest from 0x01
transaction() {
  prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {

    // saving the resource to account storage
    
    signer.save(<- Quest.createTest(), to: /storage/MyTestResource)

    // only link `&Quest.Test{Quest.ITest}`, NOT `&Quest.Test`.
    // Now the public only has access to the things in `Quest.EYETest`.

    signer.link<&Quest.Test{Quest.EYETest}>(/public/MyTestResource, target: /storage/MyTestResource)
  }

  execute {

  }
}


Run a script that tries to access a non-exposed field in the resource interface, and see the error pop up.


import Quest from 0x01

transaction(address: Address) {
  prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {

  }

  execute {
    let publicCapability: Capability<&Quest.Test> =
      getAccount(address).getCapability<&Quest.Test>(/public/MyTestResource)

    // ERROR: "The capability doesn't exist or you did not 
    // specify the right type when you got the capability."

    let testResource: &Quest.Test = publicCapability.borrow() 
    
    ?? panic("The capability doesn't exist or you did not specify the right type when you got the capability.")

    testResource.changeName(newName: "Four Eyes")
  }
}


Run the script and access something you CAN read from. Return it from the script.

import Quest from 0x01

pub fun main(address: Address): String {
  
  let publicCapability: Capability<&Quest.Test{Quest.EYETest}> =
    getAccount(address).getCapability<&Quest.Test{Quest.EYETest}>(/public/MyTestResource)

  let testResource: &Quest.Test{Quest.EYETest} = publicCapability.borrow() 
  
  ?? panic("The capability doesn't exist or you did not specify the right type when you got the capability.")

  // This works because `name` is in `&Quest.Test{Quest.EYETest}`

  return testResource.name
}
