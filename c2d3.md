In a script, initialize an array (that has length == 3) of your favourite people, represented as Strings, and log it.

    var mypipo: [String] = ["wife", "son", "daughter"]
    log (mypipo)}

In a script, initialize a dictionary that maps the Strings Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, and LinkedIn to a UInt64 
that represents the order in which you use them from most to least. For example, YouTube --> 1, Reddit --> 2, etc. If you've never used one before, map it to 0!

var socials: {String: UInt64} = {"Facebook": 0, "Instagram": 1, "Twitter": 2, "YouTube": 3, "Reddit": 4, "LinkedIn": 5}
log (socials)

How to fix it

the force unwrap operator !


pub fun main(): String {

	return thing[0x03]!
}
