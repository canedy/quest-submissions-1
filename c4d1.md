Explain what lives inside of an account.

Contracts and Their Own Data  


What is the difference between the /storage/, /public/, and /private/ paths?

/storage/ = where all the contracts and data resides in the account

/public/ = anybody can view it

/private/ = only the account holder can view it and whomever they allow to view it 



What does .save() do? What does .load() do? What does .borrow() do?

.save() = inserts data into an account

.load() = removes data from an account

.borrow() = views data in an account  


Explain why we couldn't save something to our account storage inside of a script.

because scripts are only used to view what is on the blockchain


Explain why I couldn't save something to your account.

because you do not have authorization to save something to my account only the account holder has that authorization 


Define a contract that returns a resource that has at least 1 field in it. Then, write 2 transactions:

pub contract OneField {

  pub resource One {
    pub var name: String
    init() {
      self.name = "Field"
    }
  }

  pub fun createOne(): @One {
    return <- create One()
  }

}

A transaction that first saves the resource to account storage, then loads it out of account storage, logs a field inside the resource, and destroys it.

import OneField from 0x01
transaction() {
  prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {
    let oneResource <- OneField.createOne()
    signer.save(<- oneResource, to: /storage/MyOneResource) 

    // saves `oneResource` to my account storage at this path:
    // /storage/MyOneResource

    let outResource <- signer.load<@OneField.One>(from: /storage/MyOneResource)!
    log(outResource.name)
    
    destroy outResource
    log ("Field Destroyed")
  }
    
  execute {

  }
}



A transaction that first saves the resource to account storage, then borrows a reference to it, and logs a field inside the resource.


import OneField from 0x01
transaction() {
  prepare(signer: AuthAccount) {
    let oneResource <- OneField.createOne()
    signer.save(<- oneResource, to: /storage/MyOneResource) 

    // saves `oneResource` to my account storage at this path:
    // /storage/MyOneResource

    let lookResource = signer.borrow<&OneField.One>(from: /storage/MyOneResource)
     ?? panic("A `@OneField.One` resource does not live here.")
    log(lookResource.name)
    

  }
    
  execute {

  }
}
